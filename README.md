# dots ...

As soon as I started developing I became interested in making sure the machine I
was working on for at least 8 hours a day felt pleasant to look at and worked
well.

I'm amazed at the amount of ways you can tweak your machine and tools to work
for you and to look the way you want. If not, then you can also freely build
your own.

This is a growing collection of my dot files that serve to make my machine both
pleasing to look at (for me), and function the way I want it to. These aren't
meant to be placed and used on someone else's machine, but to serve as an
example of one setup to hopefully give someone else ideas like the countless dot
file repos I've scoured through.

I use a combination of Mac (for work) and Linux (for personal), and I used [GNU
Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) for managing everything. If you've
never used Stow before, it's a life-saver for managing dot files. The general
idea is that if my structure in each profile mimics the structure of my actual
machine, I can simply `stow nvim` for example, to link all of my nvim related
files in the nvim directory to their related places on my machine.
